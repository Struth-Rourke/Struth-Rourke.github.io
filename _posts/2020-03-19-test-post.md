# Black-Scholes and Option Pricing
## History
 The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model was 

## BSM Model


# Modeling
## Models

Linear Regression and Random Forest
Why these?

## Dataset
Why this one?
Cleaning and analysis
- code snippets


## Features
BSM equation inputs, strike(X), current underlying price(S), risk-free rate(r), time to maturity (T), N(d1), N(d2).

## Scoring
root mean squared error, r^2,


## Permutation and Feature Importance
via permutation importance, you can see how each of the models did when given certain inputs; 3 linear models and outputs, 2 
random forests and outputs; 

- Graphing relationship between trade delta and option price
