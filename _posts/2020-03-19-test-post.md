# Option Pricing

## History
The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model was first introduced in 1973 by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in their
seminal paper titled, "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities" published in the *Journal of Political Economy*. It's
influence on financial markets is hard to understate, and in recognition of their work, Scholes and Merton were awarded the 
Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997. Since it's publication, the BSM pricing model 


## BSM Model Inputs, Outputs and Methodology
Their are a number of assumptions that needed to be made in order for Black and Scholes to create a valuation model that 
satisfies the condition of no aribitrage opportunities. The idea is that, given the underlying stock price (S), strike 
price(X), risk-free rate(r), time to maturity(T), and N(d1) and N(d2) you can calculate the price of this option based on the 
discounted value of the strike based on the time and a gaussian distribution of returns. The N(d1) and N(d2) terms are 
probabilities; N(d1) is thought of as the conditional probability of ..... N(d2) is thought of as the probability that the 
option price is expire in-the-money(ITM). When combined, these factors can be used to value both call and put options -- while 
satisfying the no arbitrage condition mentioned earlier via put-call parity.

# Modeling
Linear Regression and Random Forest (Why?)
Linear v. Nonlinear (ensemble)
Methodology - if a model can accurately predict the options trade price, using the same inputs as the BSM model, maybe we can 
reengineer, amend, or add additional parameters, to try and create a better, more effective model for pricing the true value 
of the options


## Dataset 
- Why this one? 
CBOE official source for options and option pricing data
Depth and granularity of the data, and the most official information based on what actually happens in the options market

- Cleaning and analysis
underlying ask != 0
time frame is predefined for 2019 
code snippets



## Features
- Feature Engineering (code)
risk-free rate = annualized 10-year rate for 2019 (source)
annualized volatility for 2019 = 28.88% (source)
time to maturity

Original Features: BSM equation inputs; strike(X); current underlying price(S); risk-free rate(r); time to maturity (T); 
N(d1); N(d2).

Additional Features: trade delta; the underlying ask - strike = distance from the strike; option_bid_ask_spread; 
underlying_bid_ask_spread

All Features: both sets together

# Further Analysis Road-Map
This a the beginning of a continued foray into finding new and improved ways to price options based off numeric, non-numeric, 
financial and alternative data. By utilizing both financial, and non-financial information, and repurposing other ideas from 
other disciplines, I hope to create a dataset informative enough to fit a model that can rival one that is given the BSM 
inputs. Namely, I hope to recalibrate the existing BSM model, specifically the use of Brownian Motion in defining the Random 
Walk and implement something that is more indicative of the dynamic system that is financial markets.
