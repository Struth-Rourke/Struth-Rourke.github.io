# Black-Scholes and Option Pricing

## History
The Black-Scholes-Merton(BSM) option pricing model was first introduced in 1973 by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in their
seminal paper titles, "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities" published in the Journal of Political Economy. It's
influence on financial markets is hard to understate; in recognition of their work, Scholes and Merton were awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Economics in 1997. 


## BSM Model


# Modeling
## Models

Linear Regression and Random Forest
Why these?

## Dataset
Why this one?
Cleaning and analysis
- code snippets


## Features
BSM equation inputs, strike(X), current underlying price(S), risk-free rate(r), time to maturity (T), N(d1), N(d2).

## Scoring
root mean squared error, r^2,


## Permutation and Feature Importance
via permutation importance, you can see how each of the models did when given certain inputs; 3 linear models and outputs, 2 
random forests and outputs;
