# Abstract
The guiding question for this project was, "Can a model reproduce Black-Scholes when given the same inputs?" The answer lends 
itself to other questions; if a model can accurately predict price, what other features and aspects of the model can we 
reengineer, amend (feature engineering), or tune (parameters, hyperparameters, etc.), to more effectively model the true 
option price? My thesis is that, if a model can approximate the trade price within a reasonable degree of accuracy, when given 
the same inputs as the Black-Scholes model, I should be able to reengineer and amend certain model inputs and parameters to 
create a new, more efficient model for pricing options. This lends itself to a number of questions about the efficiency of 
markets, what models are most effective and what inputs should be varied; however, I believe the question is larger than that, 
namely, how can we reengineer the Black-Scholes model factors to better predict the true value of the option, and whether or 
not the current option value, and the model value converge over time. 

The results indicate that a random forest model, given the Black-Scholes inputs of the strike, current underlying asset price, 
N(d<sub>1</sub>), N(d<sub>2</sub>), and the option type (call or put) produce a nearly perfect R^2 metric of 0.99. The most 
important factor influencing this model is the option type; when fitting another random forest to alternative data including 
the trade delta, underlying asset and option bid-ask spread, the model returned an R^2 of .7094. These metrics indicate that a 
relationship between the bid-ask spreads, which could act as a liquidity proxy, could provide valuable insights into option 
price modeling on further projects.


# Option Pricing
### History
The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model was first introduced in 1973 by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in their
seminal paper titled, "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities" published in the *Journal of Political Economy*. It's
influence on financial markets is hard to understate, and in recognition of their work, Scholes and Merton were awarded the 
Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997. Since it's publication, the BSM pricing model has become THE foundational model for pricing 
the theorectical value of all option types. For example, the Black Model is a derivation of the original BSM formula that 
is used specifically to value the price of European options on both forwards and futures. 

Prior to their publication, other research had been done to value option prices, but most models revolved around the pricing
of warrants. Most notably, Sprenkle (1961) was able to derive a formula that looks very similar to what we know today as the 
BSM model; however, there were various additional parameters that needed to be estimated (such as *k* which can be thought of 
as the discount factor adjusted for the stock specific risk) in order to derive the options value. Unfortunately, even 
Sprenkle himself could not estimate some of the these variables efficiently and reliably, creating numerous arbitrage 
opportunities. Ultimately, the BSM model won out in terms of it's effectiveness and is used today as the foremost method for 
pricing financial options.


### BSM Model Inputs, Outputs and Methodology
In order for the BSM model to work, Black and Scholes needed to make numerous assumptions:
 
  - The underlying asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion process, and the underlying returns are lognormally      distributed 
  - The continuously compounded, risk-free rate of return is both constant and known
  - The annualized volatility of the underlying asset is both constant and known
  - The continuouly compounded yield on the underlying asset is both constant and known
  - There are no transaction costs (taxes, fees, etc.) and there are no restrictions on short sales and their profits
  - The options are European, and can only be exercised at expiration
 
Outside of these assumptions, one of the most important aspects of this model to remember is that it satisfies the "no -
arbitrage" condition that the actual option price will be the one that, when included in a portfolio, will yield the risk-free 
rate of return. 

The BSM model takes the following inputs:

- ***S***: Current Stock Price
- ***X***: Strike Price
- ***r***: Continuously Compounded Risk-Free Rate 
- ***T***: Time to Maturity (based on the percentage of the year left until expiration)
- ***sigma***: Annualized Volatility of the underlying assets returns
- ***N(+ / - d)***: Cumulative Standard Normal Probability of d<sub>1</sub> or d<sub>2</sub> (positive value for calls and negative for puts)
- ***d<sub>1</sub>***:

- ***d<sub>2</sub>***:

and outputs the Call (C) and Put (P) prices via the equations below:

<img src="/img/Screen Shot 2020-04-30 at 5.07.37 PM.png"> 


To simplify the equation inputs, I estimated the risk-free rate (2.14%) by using the 2019, 10-year treasury yields as a 
proxy, which I attained from the US Treasury website. I used the 10-year, and not the Fed Funds rate, because of the inability 
for retail traders to have access to borrowing and lending at the Fed Funds rate. Additionally, I estimated the annualized 
volatility (28.88%) of the underlying index for 2019 from information gathered on the macrotrends website.


# Modeling
I chose to fit two different model types: a Linear Regression and a Random Forest Regression. I chose the Linear Regression 
model because of it's interpretability as well as the fact that a linear model will define whether or not a linear 
relationship between the variables exists. This is a good, simple model that can be used as a starting point as I compare 
across other model types. The baseline inputs regress the underlying stock price and the option type in an attempt to predict 
the actual trade price of the option.

The other model I chose to fit was a Random Forest Regression; which was chosen for a number of reasons. First, it is similar 
to the binomial option pricing model which uses a decision tree methodology for pricing based on the probability of the 
underlying asset movements over time. Secondly, the fact that a Random Forest is an ensemble method, which amalgamates the 
outputs of many decision trees to inform the final output, works well when trying to estimate nonlinear relationships between 
variables. Finally, a Random Forest Regression is able to handle multicollinearity better than most other models, which is 
important to consider when modeling variables that have interdependencies with one another.

The guiding question for this project was: "Can a model predict the actual trade price of an option if given the same inputs
as the BSM model?" The answer lends itself to another question; if a model can accurately predict price, what other features 
and aspects of the model can we reengineer, amend (feature engineering), or tune (parameters, hyperparameters, etc.), to more 
effectively model the true option price?

### Dataset and Feature Engineering 
I chose to predict the actual options trade price for those on the SPX (S&P 500 Index, which does NOT pay dividends) for the 
2019 year. My information was gathered from the Chicago Board Option Exchange (CBOE); because the CBOE is the official source 
for options and option pricing data, I figured it would be the most accurate source for all the necessary information to 
calculate the BSM model variables. Although the dataset was relatively clean, there were some adjustments that I needed to 
make in order to get it in the right condition for modeling. For example, I needed to filter out all the information for 2020, 
and make sure that all the strike and unerlying bid-ask information didn't contain information that would create errors when 
creating the BSM model features.

I was able to reengineer the BSM inputs using the code below:

```python
def bsm_inputs(dataf):
    
    Y = dataf.copy()
    
    S = Y['underlying_ask']
    K = Y['strike']
    r = Y['risk_free_rate']
    v = Y['annualized_vol']
    T = Y['T']
    
    D1 = ((np.log(S / K) + (r + (v ** 2 / 2))) * T) / (v * np.sqrt(T))
    Y['d1'] = D1
    
    D2 = D1 - (v * np.sqrt(T))
    Y['d2'] = D2
    
    Nd1 = norm.cdf(D1)
    Y['nd1'] = Nd1
    
    Nd2 = norm.cdf(D2)
    Y['nd2'] = Nd2
    
    return Y
```

This code takes a dataframe and assigns variables to particular columns inside that dataframe; in particular, the columns 
necessary for calculating the N(d) terms and their respective inputs. It then creates a new dataframe column by applying a 
formula inside the function (ex: D1) and then using that newly created column(ex: Y['d1']) to inform the creation of the next 
column (ex: Y['d2']). At the end, it returns the new completed dataframe with all the additional columns. As stated before, I 
used a risk-free rate of return of 2.14%, and an annualized volatiltiy of 28.88%. 

I chose four seperate feature groups to test my models on:

```python
# Features
baseline_features = ['underlying_ask', 'option_type']
bsm_features=['option_type', 'underlying_ask', 'strike', 'erT', 'nd1', 
              'nd2']

other_features=['trade_iv', 'trade_delta', 'option_bid_ask_spread',
                'underlying_bid_ask_spread', 'risk_free_rate', 
                'annualized_vol']

all_features= bsm_features + other_features

# Target 
target= 'trade_price'
```
The rest of this post will speak to the modeling results and subsequent analysis that was done following.

### Results and Scoring
To evaluate my models, I chose three metrics: (1) Mean Squared Error (MSE), (2) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and
(3) R^2 Score. These were chosen based on my understanding of statistics and econometrics, as well as their interpretability. 
The following are the coefficients, intercepts and evaluation metrics for each of the Linear Regression models specified by 
their respective feature sets:

| **Variables** | **Baseline Coefficients** | **BSM Input Coefficients** | **Other Input Coefficients** | **All Input Coefficients** |
| :--- | :--- | | :--- | :--- | : --- |
| underlying_ask | -1.80 | 4.98 | -- | 12.58 |
| nd1 | -- | 42.84 | -- | 38.50 |
| strike | -- | -11.85 | -- | -33.13 |
| erT | -- | -7.29  | -- | -8.17 |
| nd2 | -- | -44.48 | -- | -50.22 |
| option_type | 4.83 | 8.37 | -- | 2.09 |
| trade_iv | -- | -- |-1.49 | -16.24 |
| trade_delta | -- | -- | 7.10 | 5.47 |
| option_bid_ask_spread | -- | -- | 5.20 | 3.71 |
| underlying_bid_ask_spread | -- | -- | -0.28 | .025 |
| risk_free_rate | -- | -- | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| annualized_vol | -- | -- | 0.00 | 0.00 |
|  |  |  |  |
| **Metrics:** |  |  |  |
| **MSE** | **3700.74** | **3277.38** | **3596.78** | **3171.49** |
| **RMSE** | **60.83** | **57.24** | **59.97** | **56.31** |
| **R^2** | **.0067** | **0.1203** | **0.0346** | **0.1487** |

The absolute value of the above coefficients speak to the importance of each feature within that given model; most notably, 
the coefficient values for "nd1" and "nd2", for the BSM and All Inputs models, exceed that of another other feature. This does 
make some intuitive sense in that the Random Walk probability that they estimate does play a large role in the models 
determination of price. One thing to consider further is the nonlinear impact that these, and other, variables will have on 
pricing. The stock market is a dynamic system, with different linear, and nonlinear relationships between variables that 
ultimate coalesce together to create the markets reality.

In regards to the Random Forest modeling, I ran two random forest models with different inputs: (1) with the BSM model inputs, 
and (2) with the other, alternative feature inputs. The following feature importance graphs illustrate the magnitude of each 
features importance in that particular model.

Not surprisingly, the option type is the foremost predictor of the actual option trade price because of how the BSM 
model formula calculates the particular price for each option type. Somewhat surpringly is the R^2 score generated for this 
model which yielded an R^2 = 0.9938; although somewhat concerning due to possible feature leakage, we can assume that the 
leakage is not an immediate concern because of the additional research done later on to identify whether or not these feature 
importances change based on permutation importances with the ELI5 library. In conclusion, we can speculate that this random 
foerst model does some calculation very similar to the BSM model to predict option prices. 

The following graph is the feature importances graph for the Random Forest that is specified with the other, alternative 
inputs.

Surprisingly, the trade delta and bid-ask spreads for both the option itself, and the underlying stock, can account for a vast 
majority of the explained variance with an  R^2 = 0.7094. This insinuates that additional analysis should be done looking into 
the specific effect that each option greek has on the trade price and whether or not they alone, or supplementally, can 
accurately predict the trade price with consistency. It also poses the question of how much liquidity, or the lack there of, 
plays into pricing -- when the bid-ask spread widen, it sends a signal that the buyers and sellers in the market are further 
away from reconciliation price than otherwise. More analysis should be done on the role that liquidty plays into option 
pricing, and exploring other ways that liquidty can be proxied.

### Permutation Feature Importances
In order to accurately determine whether or not these features are as important to the model as defined, I used the ELI5 
library to calculate the premutation feature importance of the two best linear and random forest models. The methodology for 
applying this is simple; importance can be measured by how much the score (accuracy, MSE, R^2, etc.) decreases
when a feature is not available -- to do this, the ELI5 library produces random noise in the dataset by rearranging the 
values, but keeping the distribution of those values consistent. Permutation importances calculate whether or not that 
random noise has an effect on the model and the respective features, and produces model weights within a range to determine 
which feature is or isn't important. When compared to the original model coefficients, we can certainly observe a difference 
in feature weights and importances. The below figures speak to each models permutation feature importances and what they 
indicate about the respective models.

ELI5 Weight Charts:

**Linear Model 1 (BSM Model Inputs)**

**Linear Model 3 (All Model Inputs)**

<img src="/img/Screen Shot 2020-04-30 at 1.57.12 PM.png">


When viewing the linear regression model outputs after doing permutation feature importances, there is a marked change in what 
features matter the most, and which don't. In the original linear models, the most important features were the N(d) terms; 
after accounting for the permutations, the most important features are the strike and underlying ask price. This brings to 
light the idea that linear models do in fact struggle with mapping nonlinear relationships between variables. 


**Random Forest Model 1 (BSM Model Inputs)**

**Random Forest Model 2 (Other Model Inputs)**

<img src="/img/Screen Shot 2020-04-30 at 1.56.51 PM.png">

After permuting on the random forest model inputs, the feature importances did not change much, which indicates that the 
original model did a good job in identifying the most important features. It also validates the strengths of those features, 
because even after adding noise, they were still the most predictive features. It also provides their respective weights and 
interval ranges which helps to identify the actual weights these models are putting on their inputs.


### Additional Visualizations
Because the trade delta had such a high feature importance score in the second Random Forest with the alternative data inputs,
I created a plot that compares the trade delta and trade price, with two marginal graphs along the x and y axis which speak to 
datasets distributions. I also included a regression trendline (in green) to identify the R^2 of just the trade delta on the 
trade price. It indicates that there is a strong linear relationship between delta, and trade price; interestingly, the linear 
models I fit did not show delta to be as large a factor as it seems to be here. I contribute some of this to the noise some 
other factors may cause in the model.

# Further Analysis Road-Map
This is the beginning of a foray into finding new and improved ways to price options based on both numeric and non-
numeric, financial and alternative data. By utilizing all this different, varying information, and repurposing ideas from 
other disciplines, I hope to create a dataset informative enough to create a model that can rival one that is given only the 
BSM model inputs. Namely, I hope to recalibrate the existing BSM model, specifically in relation to the use of geometric 
Brownian Motion in defining the Random Walk of stock prices, and create something that is more indicative of the dynamic 
system that is financial markets. I also plan on looking into what option greeks are most informative to option 
pricing theory, and whether they can be utilized seperately, or recombined with other factors, to reliably predict the trade 
price of options. 

Topic List for Continued Research:
- Modeling Option Greeks Predictive Power of Option Trade Price
- Alternative to Geometric Brownian Motion
- Additional Alternative Data Points for Predictive Power
- Correlation Coefficient of the SPX v. VIX / VXX
- Approximating Liquidity and Liquidity Proxies
